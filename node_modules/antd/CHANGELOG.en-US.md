## 3.0.0

`2017-12-04`

Learn more in the [Ant Design 3.0 announcement post](https://medium.com/ant-design/announcing-ant-design-3-0-70e3e65eca0c)!

### Major Changes

- New [color system](https://ant.design/docs/spec/colors#Color-Palettes), We changed our primary color from 『`#108EE9`』 to 『`#1890FF`』, we called the new primary color "拂晓蓝 (Daybreak Blue)" which means the color of the sky at daybreak.
- New design of components.
- Increased the base font size from 12px to 14px.
- Changed default locale to `en_US`.
- Support React 16.
- Better TypeScript support.
- New [List](https://ant.design/components/list/) component.
- New [Divider](https://ant.design/components/divider/) component.
- 30 New [icons](https://ant.design/components/icon/).

### Breaking Changes

We provide a [migration tool](https://github.com/ant-design/antd-migration-helper) to help you find deprecated usages in your codebase.

- Card's `noHovering` has been renamed to `hoverable`，and its default value now is `true`.
- Added new Grid breakpoints. [#7230](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/pull/7230)
- Form `getFieldDecorator`'s `exclusive` option has been removeed.
- Added `Form.createFormField`, and you must use it to wrap field data returned in `option.mapPropsToFields`:

  ```diff
  import { Form } from 'antd';

  Form.create({
    mapPropsToFields() {
      return {
  -     name: { value: 'antd' },
  +     name: Form.createFormField({ value: 'antd' }),
      };
    },
  })
  ```

- Improved global reset style, if you encounter style problem after upgrading, you can try import our v2 compatible style.

  ```javascript
  import 'antd/lib/style/v2-compatible-reset';
  ```

  Or use less

  ```less
  @import '~antd/lib/style/v2-compatible-reset.less';
  ```

- Since we changed default locale to en_US, LocalProvider is not required any more for English users.
- We don't set `size="large"` to `Input` in `Form` by default any more.
- `Input.Search` 🔍 icon don't be interactive anymore, you can use new `enterButton` prop to add a button after input.
- UMD version of `dist/antd.js` doesn't include moment any more, you need add moment by yourself if you are using the UMD version.
  ```diff
  <html>
    <head>
  +   <script src="https://unpkg.com/moment@2.19.3/moment.js"></script>
      <script src="https://unpkg.com/antd@3.0.0/dist/antd.js"></script>
    </head>
  </html>
  ```

- Don't need set `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` when using in TypeScript.
- We removed `react@0.14` and `react@15` from `peerDependencies`, though `antd@3.0` still works on old React versions, but we highly recommend you upgrading to React 16 since we may use the new features only exists in React 16 in the future. See [React 16](https://reactjs.org/blog/2017/09/26/react-v16.0.html)
